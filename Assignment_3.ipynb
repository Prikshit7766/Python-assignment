    "- Functions are advantageous to have in programs for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reusability: Functions allow you to write a block of code once and use it repeatedly in different parts of your program. This saves time and effort and makes your code more efficient and manageable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Modularity: By breaking down your program into smaller, self-contained functions, you can organize your code into logical and functional components. This makes it easier to understand and maintain your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Abstraction: Functions allow you to hide the details of a complex algorithm or process behind a simple and easy-to-use interface. This abstraction helps to make your code more understandable and user-friendly.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Debugging: By isolating specific blocks of code in functions, it makes it easier to debug and troubleshoot errors. If a function is not working as expected, you can focus your efforts on that specific function instead of having to comb through the entire program.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Testing: Functions make it easier to test your code because you can test each function individually, ensuring that it works correctly before integrating it into the rest of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, functions improve the organization, maintainability, and efficiency of your code.\n"

    "\n",
    "When the function is called in the program, either by using its name followed by parentheses or by referencing it from another part of the program, the code inside the function is executed. The arguments (if any) that are passed to the function are evaluated, and the resulting values are used within the function.\n",
    "\n",
